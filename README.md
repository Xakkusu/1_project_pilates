# Pipalates
Pipalates is a static website that offers a pilates studio an online platform. The Pipalates studio itself offers pilates courses which are meant to improve the customers wellbeing. Through this website the user is informed about those services, about the studio and pilates over all. This website is hence meant to have a userbase made up of already existing customers as well as people that are interested in pilates and reformer classes in Vienna, Austria.

Pipalates' website includes basic pilates information, information about what courses exist and at what time those take place. Moreover, the website gives the user information about previous customer experience via their feedback section. The location as well as more studio and team information is given to the user. If the user wants to stay up-to-date with information from the studio he or she can subscribe to a newsletter.

## FINAL DESIGN
### Imagery
All images on the webpage were taken from pexels.com and unsplash.com. I have credited these in the [credits](#credits) section. All images on this website are free stock photos which are royalty free. The images were selected as they showed pilates, a pilates studio and people in an aesthetically pleasing way. The studio images were especially chosen in line with the color theme used for this website using brownish earthly colors. Hence these colors correlate as good as possible with a relaxed but yet strong overall theme of the website and pilates itself.

### Color Scheme
![Pipalates Color Palette](docs/readme-images/colorscheme.png)
Brown-redish and beige colors were chosen for a relaxed feeling but at the same time a sense of strength. Brown colors are often used in pilates studio designs as well as in pilates' clothing and accessories therefore these colors were chosen as they are already established within the community.
The color palette was created by using the [coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the following fonts:
- ![Montserrat font image](docs/readme-images/montserrat.PNG) 
[Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was chosen for the main body as it was neutral and easy to read.
- ![Raleway font image](docs/readme-images/raleway.PNG) 
For the final H1 Heading [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) was used to lift the website's name/Logo apart from the other text, but not too much to keep in line with the general visual outlook of the page.
- Sans Serif was chosen as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

### Visual Effects
Images and more information for these effects are given in the [Features](#feautures) part.
#### Shadows
The navbar/header-element has a box-shadow on the mobile device as well as on all other screen sizes as it is fixed at the top of the screen while scrolling. Through this it sets itself apart from the other content, hinders blending with said content and serves as a visual-anchor-point for users.
The Get Connected Form, the content of the schedule-table, images of trainers and feedback elements all have shadows as well to lift themselves up from the other content.
#### Navbar Hover Effect
On larger screens when choosing a menu-section a hover-effect will appear on the topic on which the cursor is "on top off". The font-color will turn white while the background will appear in a darker brown color to make it stand out.
#### Hover over images
On large screens for the feedback text, instead of being under the images of the image, the text will be shown on top of it while hovering over them. The font-color will turn white and the background color brown-reddish to make it stand out.
#### Button
On the Sign-Up-Form of the get connected page when hovering over the "sign up" button the buttons font-color and background color will switch. Thus the font-color will be white and the background color a dark brown. The cursor itself will be shown as a cursor when hovering the element. This is done to on the one hand make it stand out and on the other signal to the user that it can be clicked.

### User Stories Testing
#### First Time User Goals
- I want the main purpose of the website to be easy to understand
    
    The website's main content is clearly presented on the index page (and other pages) and its structure is similar to the top 3 pilates studio website's in Vienna so the user would be familiar with the layout.
- I want the website to be easy to navigate
    
    Through the navbar which by being fixed is present whenever the user can navigate to all pages whenever they want to.
- I want to know about services/classes being offered

    On the index page and the courses page clear and compact information about courses are presented.
- I want to know the cost of courses

    The courses page offers price details for all available courses.
- I want to know when the courses will be held

    The courses page offers a timetable with the courses. The same courses are colored the same way so it will be easier for the user to find fitting times and courses.
- I want to know where the studio is located

    On the index page the address as well as an interactive google maps tool, to show where the studio is located, is provided.
- I want to know about trainers

    The about us page offers names, images and further information about the trainers the studio employs.
- I want to know about the studios equipment

    The about us page provides several images of the Studio in the Our Studio section for the user to be able to make themself a better picture about the studio.
- I want to know how I can contact the studio

    The index page offers an e-mail address as well as a phone number. The footer with all social media links is present on all pages.

#### Returning User Goals
- I want to know updated information about courses (especially as I progress with the levels)

    The courses page is updated regularly. However, when signing up for the newsletter the user will be directly informed about new courses.
- I want to know how to contact the studio

    The index page offers an e-mail address as well as a phone number. The footer with all social media links is present on all pages.
- I want to stay up-tp-date with new classes and trainers

    The user can sign-up for the newsletter and will hence be always directly informed, about topics that interest them, via mail about all updates.

#### Frequent User Goals
- I want to stay up-tp-date with new classes and trainers + I want to stay up-to-date with new studio equipment

    The user can sign-up for the newsletter and will hence be always directly informed, about topics that interest them, via mail about all updates.

- I want to be able to to show my feedback on the website via contact information

    The index page offers an e-mail address as well as a phone number. The footer with all social media links is present on all pages. When contacting the studio via one of these channels the feedback can be displayed on the feedback section on the courses page.


### Fixed Bugs
1. Header and navbar were styled incorrectly so that the header fully covered navbar/menu when its position is fixed:
    - added top margin in main element which is the same as the height of header
    - added high z-index (99) so that the menu will stay on top of the layout when scrolling

    Now menu didn't fit screen and positioning was off:
    - added absolute position in navbar so that its position stay relative to the header and is taken out of the normal flow
    - menu items were placed directly under header with top:100% and placed left:0
2.  Table wasn't wholly visible on smaller screens
    - the table for weekdays was horizontally too large for mobile devices but adding the days below one another would have taken too much space and could be confusing for user to compare days and times
    - added overvlow-x:auto to table element to add a horizontal scroll bar for table content which was too big for its block level element; user can however always rotate their phone which would show it wholy either way
3. From 992px and upwards the size of the index-page was dislocated from the size of the screen, which after some testing was found out to have come from the Why Pilates?-section on that page
    - width of why-pilates and of best-courses section were to wide
    - added min width attribute which is smaller than starting screen size of this media query and giving it a new max width attribute, same with the best-course section
    - content were well fitted to screen size again
4. On the index page all course boxes were meant to link to the according course box on the courses page. However when opening the link on mobile devices the link would open up with a delayed jump to the box on courses page, yet only showing part of the element not the whole element:
    - got rid of the singular links for each course
    - on index page put the whole element in an anchor element which again links now through the href attribute to the whole price section (includes course boxes) one the courses page
