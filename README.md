## FINAL DESIGN
### Imagery
All images on the webpage were taken from pexels.com. I have credited these in the [credits](#credits) section. All images on this website are free stock photos which are royalty free. The images were selected as they showed pilates, a pilates studio and people in an aesthetically pleasing way. Especially the studio images were chosen in line with the color theme used for this website using brownish earthly colors. Hence these colors correlate as good as possible with a relaxed but yet strong overall theme of the website and pilates itself.

### Color Scheme
![Pipalates Color Palette](docs/readme-images/colorscheme.png)
I chose brown-redish and beige colours for a relaxed feeling but at the same time a sense of strength. Brown colors are often used in pilates sutdio designs as well as in pilates' clothing and accessoires therefore these colors were chosen as they are already established within the community.
The color palette was created by using the [coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the following fonts:
- ![Montserrat font image](docs/readme-images/montserrat.PNG) 
[Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was was chosen for the main body as it was neutral and easy to read.
- ![Raleway font image](docs/readme-images/raleway.PNG) 
For the final H1 Heading [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) was used to lift the website's name/Logo apart from the other text, but not too much to keep in line of the general visual outlook of the page.
- Sans Serif was chosen as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

### Visual Effects
Images and more information for these effects are given in the [Features](#feautures) part.
#### Shadows
The navbar/header-element has on the movie device as well as on all other screen sizes a box-shadow as it is fixed at the top of the screen while scrolling. Thrugh this it sets itself apart from the other content, hinders blending with said content and serves as a visual-anchor-point for users.
The Get Connected Form, the content of the schedule-table, images of trainers and feedback elements all have shadows as well to lift themseves up from the other content.
#### Navbar Hover Effect
On large screen when choosing a menu-section a hover-effect will appear on the topic on which the cursor is "on top off". The font-color will turn white while the background will appear in a darker brown color to make it stand out.
#### Hover over images
On large sreens the feedback text, instead of being under the images of the feedback section it will be shown on top of images while hovering over them. The font-colour will turn white and the background color brown-redish to make it stand out.
#### Button
On the Sign-Form of the get connected page when hovering over the "sign up" button the buttons font-color and background color will switch. Thus the font-color will be white and the background color a dark brown. The cursor itself will be a shown as a cursor when hovering the element. This is done to on the one hand make it stand out and on the other signal to the user that it can be clicked.

<img src="docs/features/navbar-feature.html.png" alt="navbar in browser">

- The navbar includes the Logo and the menu. The menu consists of Home, Courses, About Us, Get Connected pages, these items are located on the right.

- When selecting a menu item the selected page will open in the same window.
- When selecting the logo to index page will open.

<img src="docs/features/navbar-selected-feature.html.png" alt="hovered mentu item in  browser">

- When hovering the menu items the background color of the hovered item will change to a darker brown and its font-color will change to white.
- While being on a page the navbar menu item that belongs to the open page is shown with an underline.

<img src="docs/features/navbar-mobile-feature.html.png" alt="navbar on mobile device" width="40%">  <img src="docs/features/navbar-mobile-selected-feature.html.png" alt="navbar selected on mobile device" width="40%">

- on smaller screens the menu items are replaced by a burger-menu-icon. When selected the menu items are shown via a drop down option and can then be selected

<img src="docs/features/footer-feature.html.png" alt="footer with social media icons">

- The footer section includes Pipalates' Instagram, Youtube, TikTok and Facebook pages.
- When selecting one of these links, a new tab will open to that social-media platform.


### Index Page
#### Hero Image
<img src="docs/features/hero-image-feature.html.png" alt="hero image of a pilates studio" width="90%">

- The visually pleasing image is of a pilates studio with reformers lined up behind one another.
- The semit-transparent cover text informs the user about the main topic of the website while being in line with the overall color scheme of the website.
- The image is responsive and the cover text switches to the left side on smaller screen to not be on top of the reformer. This way the main message of the website is still transferred to the user

#### Best Courses Section
<img src="docs/features/course-section-feature.html.png" alt="a course section with short description of the course as well as one image per course" width="90%">

- This section is subdivided into 4 parts for each corse: a short description for the user of the course as well as a fitting picture of something similar to the course so the user gets a visual represantation of the course as well
- On larger screens when hovering over a course-image-box the box will have a dark border, a darker brownish background color and the fint-color will be white.
- Each course-image-box can be selected and will open a new tab to the course page to the according course that has been clicked.
- On smaller screens the images and text are ordered under one another and is hence responsive to different devices.
- This section shows the user the main service the studio offers, the courses. Through visual effects and the linked parts the user could directly transfer to the section about the courses with further information about the courses.

#### Why Pilates Section
<img src="docs/features/why-pilates-feature.html.png" alt="a brief text section of what pilates is" width="90%">

- This section gives a brief description of what pilates is and highlights its benefits to the user. 

#### Location Section
<img src="docs/features/location-feature.html.png" alt="a section with text about contact information and a google maps image of the street from birds eye view" width="90%">

- This section includes a block of different kinds of contact information and an iframe of an embedded Google Map shwoing the studio's location.
- This will enable the user to have various contact points with the studio in case of questions as well as knowing the direct location of the studio in case they will attend classes.

### Courses Page
#### Schedule Table Section
<img src="docs/features/schedule-table-feature.html.png" alt="a time table that shows when which course will take place during the week" width="90%">

- This section informs the user about the times of courses via a table.
- For easier understanding the same courses are coloured according to their level.

<img src="docs/features/schedule-table-mobile-feature.html.png" alt="schedule table on mobile device" width="40%">

- For mobile device user the full table can be accessed with a horizontal scrollbar. Through this no data is neglected by smaller sizing and it does not disrupt the reading flow of the user.
- The naming of each course with its course level in numeric letters is used as this is common practice to name courses in the pilates, yoga and aerial sports industry so useres are often already familiar with this wording

#### Course Prices Section
<img src="docs/features/price-courses-feature.html.png" alt="four course-price-boxes next to on another" width="90%">

- This section is held as simple and basic as possible, as it has to do with product/service information and the easier it is for the user to understand these the more likely they will be to chose one.
- Each course-price-box consists out of information about the course, units and its price. The boxes are responsive and are placed horizontally beneath one another on smaller devices.

#### Feedback Section
<img src="docs/features/feedback-feature.html.png" alt="four pilates images with one having a feedback-text-box in front of it" width="90%">

- This section gives the user the option to read feeback of from customers about the courses. This is dpme to give confidence to the user in the studio's abilities.
- On larger screens there is a hover effect on top of each picture. The feedback text will appear when hovering the picture.

<img src="docs/features/feedback-mobile-feature.html.png" alt="images and feedback text" width="40%">

- On smaller screens the feedback text is located below each picture so it is still readable and easy to understand in the websites colours.

### FIXED BUGS
1. header and navbar were styled incorrectly so that the header fully covered navbar/menu when its position is fixed:
    - added top margin in main element which is the same as the height of header
    - added high z-index (99) so that the menu will stay on top of the layout when scrolling
    Now menu didn't fit screen and positioning was off:
    - added absolute position in navbar so that its position stay relative to the header and is taken out of the normal flow
    - menu items were placed directly under header with top:100% and placed left:0
2.  table wasn't wholy visible on smaller screens
    - the table for weekdays was horizontally too large for mobile devices but adding the days below one another would have taken too much space and could be confusing for user to compare days and time
    - added overvlow-x:auto to tabble element to add a horizontal scroll bar for table content which was too big for its block level element; user can however always rotate their phone which would show it wholy either way
3. From 992px and upwards the size of the index-page was dislocated from the size of the screen, which after some testing was found out to have come from the Why Pilates?-section on that page
    - width of why-pilates and of best-courses section were to wide, especially the may width with no min width attribute in the why pilates section
    - added min width attribute which is smaller than starting screen size of this media query and giving it a new max width attribute, same with the best-course section
    - content were well fitted to screen size again
