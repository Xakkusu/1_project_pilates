## FINAL DESIGN
### Imagery
All images on the webpage were taken from pexels.com. I have credited these in the [credits](#credits) section. All images on this website are free stock photos which are royalty free. The images were selected as they showed pilates, a pilates studio and people in an aesthetically pleasing way. Especially the studio images were chosen in line with the color theme used for this website using brownish earthly colors. Hence these colors correlate as good as possible with a relaxed but yet strong overall theme of the website and pilates itself.

### Color Scheme
![Pipalates Color Palette](docs/readme-images/colorscheme.png)
I chose brown-redish and beige colours for a relaxed feeling but at the same time a sense of strength. Brown colors are often used in pilates sutdio designs as well as in pilates' clothing and accessoires therefore these colors were chosen as they are already established within the community.
The color palette was created by using the [coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for the following fonts:
- ![Montserrat font image](docs/readme-images/montserrat.PNG) [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was was chosen for the main body as it was neutral and easy to read.
- ![Raleway font image](docs/readme-images/raleway.PNG) For the final H1 Heading [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) was used to lift the website's name/Logo apart from the other text, but not too much to keep in line of the general visual outlook of the page.
- Sans Serif was chosen as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

### Visual Effects
Images and more information for these effects are given in the [Features](#feautures) part.
#### Shadows
The mavbar/header-element has on the movie device as well as on all other screen sizes a box-shadow as it is fixed at the top of the screen while scrolling. Thrugh this it sets itself apart from the other content and serves as a visual-anchor-point for users.
#### Navbar Hover Effect
On large screen when choosing a menu-section a hover-effect will appear on the topic on which the cursor is "on top off". The font-color will turn white while the background will appear in a darker brown color to make it stand out.
#### Hover over images
On large sreens the feedback text, instead of being under the images of the feedback section it will be shown on top of images while hovering over them. The font-colour will turn white and the background color brown-redish to make it stand out.
#### Button
On the Sign-Form of the get connected page when hovering over the "sign up" button the buttons font-color and background color will switch. Thus the font-color will be white and the background color a dark brown. The cursor itself will be a shown as a cursor when hovering the element. This is done to on the one hand make it stand out and on the other signal to the user that it can be clicked.

## FEAUTURES

### How to Use

## TESTING

### FIXED BUGS
1. header and navbar were styled incorrectly so that the header fully covered navbar/menu when its position is fixed:
    - added top margin in main element which is the same as the height of header
    - added high z-index (99) so that the menu will stay on top of the layout when scrolling
    Now menu didn't fit screen and positioning was off:
    - added absolute position in navbar so that its position stay relative to the header and is taken out of the normal flow
    - menu items were placed directly under header with top:100% and placed left:0
2.  table wasn't wholy visible on smaller screens
    - the table for weekdays was horizontally too large for mobile devices but adding the days below one another would have taken too much space and could be confusing for user to compare days and time
    - added overvlow-x:auto to tabble element to add a horizontal scroll bar for table content which was too big for its block level element; user can however always rotate their phone which would show it wholy either way
3. From 992px and upwards the size of the index-page was dislocated from the size of the screen, which after some testing was found out to have come from the Why Pilates?-section on that page
    - width of why-pilates and of best-courses section were to wide, especially the may width with no min width attribute in the why pilates section
    - added min width attribute which is smaller than starting screen size of this media query and giving it a new max width attribute, same with the best-course section
    - content were well fitted to screen size again
